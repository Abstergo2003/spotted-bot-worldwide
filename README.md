# spotted-bot-dc
this is bot that creates spotted infrascturcture on your dc channel
when it joins it creates 4 channels and 1 role

1 channel: post - on this channel every one can post, message get deleted, and posted on channel spotted

2 channel: img - only member having role spotter is able to send messages there, but be carefull, there shouldnt be sent messages without pictures, messages got dleted from here and appear at spotted channel

3 channel: spotted - here are posted messages by bot which makes them anonim, messages containing swears are hiden behind spoiler, anly bot and admin are able to type on this channel

4 channel: logs - only admin can acces this channel, bot text here sender of message and its text and attachments

1 role: - spotter, remember to give this role only to trusted people since there is no way to check if image contains or not porn, users having this role are able to post on image channel, but still sending files other than images is prohibited

I strongly advise to set slow mode on image and post channel not to get it spammed to easily

bot reacts only to messages sent on post and image channel, there is no need to type command, just type message that you want to post on spotted and hit enter
